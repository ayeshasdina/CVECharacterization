Vulnerability in the Oracle Financial Services Profitability Management product of Oracle Financial Services Applications (component: User Interface). Supported versions that are affected are 8.0.6 and 8.0.7. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Financial Services Profitability Management. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation  deletion or modification access to critical data or all Oracle Financial Services Profitability Management accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Financial Services Profitability Management accessible data. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 7.1 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N).,Application,Application,Reasoning not added.
** DISPUTED ** airhost.exe in Zoom Client for Meetings 4.6.11 uses the SHA-256 hash of 0123425234234fsdfsdr3242 for initialization of an OpenSSL EVP AES-256 CBC context. NOTE: the vendor states that this initialization only occurs within unreachable code.,Channel,Application,Reasoning not added.
** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. The SIP implementation does not properly use authentication with encryption: it is vulnerable to replay attacks  packet injection attacks  and man in the middle attacks. An attacker is able to successfully use SIP to communicate with the device from anywhere within the LAN. An attacker may use this to crash the device  stop it from communicating with the SMA servers  exploit known SIP vulnerabilities  or find sensitive information from the SIP communications. Furthermore  because the SIP communication channel is unencrypted  an attacker capable of understanding the protocol can eavesdrop on communications. For example  passwords can be extracted. NOTE: the vendor s position is that authentication with encryption is not required on an isolated subnetwork. Also  only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.,Channel,Channel,Reasoning not added.
** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. The SMAdata2+ communication protocol does not properly use authentication with encryption: it is vulnerable to man in the middle  packet injection  and replay attacks. Any setting change  authentication packet  scouting packet  etc. can be replayed  injected  or used for a man in the middle session. All functionalities available in Sunny Explorer can effectively be done from anywhere within the network as long as an attacker gets the packet setup correctly. This includes the authentication process for all (including hidden) access levels and the changing of settings in accordance with the gained access rights. Furthermore  because the SMAdata2+ communication channel is unencrypted  an attacker capable of understanding the protocol can eavesdrop on communications. NOTE: the vendor s position is that authentication with encryption is not required on an isolated subnetwork. Also  only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.,Channel,Channel,Reasoning not added.
** DISPUTED ** On BC Vault devices  a side channel for the row-based SSD1309 OLED display was found. The power consumption of each row-based display cycle depends on the number of illuminated pixels  allowing a partial recovery of display contents. For example  a hardware implant in the USB cable might be able to leverage this behavior to recover a data value. In other words  the side channel is relevant only if the attacker has enough control over the device s USB connection to make power-consumption measurements at a time when secret data is displayed. The side channel is not relevant in other circumstances  such as a stolen device that is not currently displaying secret data. NOTE: the vendor s position is that there is no security impact: the only potentially leaked information is the number of characters in the PIN.,Physical Hardware,Physical Hardware,Reasoning not added.
