mitigation_definition = """
Mitigation describes the techniques and strategies that can be used to limit the impact of a vulnerability, even if it is exploited. 
It encompasses various preventive measures aimed at reducing the likelihood or severity of successful exploits.
"""

mitigation_desc = """
Mitigation:
1. Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
•	Definition: A vulnerability is characterized by ASLR mitigation if ASLR is an applicable protection mechanism to guard against buffer overflows.
•	Examples:
o	Randomizing the memory addresses of system components to prevent predictable memory targeting.
o	Protecting against stack-based and heap-based buffer overflow attacks.
•	Common Methods:
o	Enabling ASLR in operating system settings.
o	Compiling software with ASLR support to improve memory safety.

________________________________________
2. HPKP/HSTS
•	Definition: If HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) or HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is applicable as a mitigation strategy.
•	Examples:
o	Using HSTS to enforce secure connections via HTTPS.
o	Implementing HPKP to pin specific public keys and protect against certificate spoofing.
•	Common Methods:
o	Configuring web servers to include HSTS headers in HTTP responses.
o	Pinning trusted public keys in browsers to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

________________________________________
3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
•	Definition: It is used if MFA is a viable protection technique for a vulnerability.
•	Examples:
o	Requiring an additional verification step, such as a one-time password, alongside a traditional password.
o	Using biometric authentication to strengthen access control.
•	Common Methods:
o	Integrating MFA into login workflows for critical systems.
o	Using mobile-based or hardware token generators for second-factor authentication.

________________________________________
4. Physical Security
•	Definition: Ensuring physical security provides protection from exploits caused by a vulnerability.
•	Examples:
o	Restricting physical access to servers to prevent tampering or unauthorized access.
o	Implementing surveillance and secure access control systems in data centers.
•	Common Methods:
o	Using locked cabinets or safes for sensitive equipment.
o	Deploying biometric or card-based physical access controls.

________________________________________
5. Sandboxed
•	Definition: If deploying a software product in the sandbox provides protection against vulnerabilities.
•	Examples:
o	Running applications in isolated environments to prevent system-wide impacts.
o	Sandboxing web browsers to contain malicious code execution.
•	Common Methods:
o	Using virtualized or containerized environments to limit the scope of exploits.
o	Implementing process sandboxing in operating systems to restrict access to critical resources.

1. ASLR
Adobe Character Animator versions 32 and earlier have a buffer overflow vulnerability Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
Adobe DNG Software Development Kit (SDK) 15 and earlier versions have an out-of-bounds read vulnerability Successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure.

2. HPKP/HSTS
meinheld prior to 102 is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling HTTP pipelining issues and request smuggling attacks might be possible due to incorrect Content-Length and Transfer encoding header parsing
goliath through 106 allows request smuggling attacks where goliath is used as a backend and a frontend proxy also being vulnerable It is possible to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks by sending the Content-Length header twice Furthermore invalid Transfer Encoding headers were found to be parsed as valid which could be leveraged for TE:CL smuggling attacks

3. MultiFactor Authentication
Certain Xerox WorkCentre printers before 073xxx00002300 do not require the user to reenter or validate LDAP bind credentials when changing the LDAP connector IP address A malicious actor who gains access to affected devices (eg by using default credentials) can change the LDAP connection IP address to a system owned by the actor without knowledge of the LDAP bind credentials After changing the LDAP connection IP address subsequent authentication attempts will result in the printer sending plaintext LDAP (Active Directory) credentials to the actor Although the credentials may belong to a non-privileged user organizations frequently use privileged service accounts to bind to Active Directory The attacker gains a foothold on the Active Directory domain at a minimum and may use the credentials to take over control of the Active Directory domain This affects 3655* 3655i* 58XX* 58XXi* 59XX* 59XXi* 6655** 6655i** 72XX* 72XXi* 78XX** 78XXi** 7970** 7970i** EC7836** and EC7856** devices.
Insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability on Micro Focus enterprise developer and enterprise server affecting all version prior to 40 Patch Update 16 and version 50 Patch Update 6 The vulnerability could allow an attacker to transmit hashed credentials for the user account running the Micro Focus Directory Server (MFDS) to an arbitrary site compromising that accounts security.

4. Physical Security
An authorization issue was addressed with improved state management This issue is fixed in iOS 135 and iPadOS 135 A person with physical access to an iOS device may be able to view notification contents from the lockscreen.

5. Sandboxed

6. Example of MultiFactor Authentication and Physical Security:
A security restriction bypass vulnerability has been discovered in Revive Adserver version < 505 by HackerOne user hoangn144 Revive Adserver like many other applications requires the logged in user to type the current password in order to change the e-mail address or the password It was however possible for anyone with access to a Revive Adserver admin user interface to bypass such check and change e-email address or password of the currently logged in user by altering the form payloadThe attack requires physical access to the user interface of a logged in user If the POST payload was altered by turning the  pwold  parameter into an array Revive Adserver would fetch and authorise the operation even if no password was provided

7. Example of ASLR and HPKP/HSTS:
IBM Watson IoT Message Gateway 200x 5000 5001 and 5002 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow caused by improper bounds checking when handling a failed HTTP request with specific content in the headers By sending a specially crafted HTTP request a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service IBM X-Force ID: 174972

8. Example of ASLR and Sandboxed:
VMware ESXi (70 before ESXi_700-12016321839 67 before ESXi670-202004101-SG and 65 before ESXi650-202005401-SG) Workstation (15x before 1555) and Fusion (11x before 1155) contain an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the Shader functionality A malicious actor with non-administrative local access to a virtual machine with 3D graphics enabled may be able to exploit this vulnerability to crash the virtual machines vmx process leading to a partial denial of service condition

Select Dell Client Consumer and Commercial platforms include an issue that allows the BIOS Admin password to be changed through Dells manageability interface without knowledge of the current BIOS Admin password This could potentially allow an unauthorized actor with physical access and/or OS administrator privileges to the device to gain privileged access to the platform and the hard drive
    d. Multiple integer overflows in the Pre-EFI Initialization (PEI) boot phase in the Capsule Update feature in the UEFI implementation in EDK2 allow physically proximate attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by providing crafted data that is not properly handled during the coalescing phase
    e. Directory traversal vulnerability in the Android debug bridge (aka adb) in Android 404 allows physically proximate attackers with a direct connection to the target Android device to write to arbitrary files owned by system via a  (dot dot) in the tar archive headers
    f. Seagate ST500LT015 hard disk drives when operating in eDrive mode on Lenovo ThinkPad W541 laptops with BIOS 221 allow physically proximate attackers to bypass self-encrypting drive (SED) protection by attaching a second SATA connector to exposed pins maintaining an alternate power source and attaching the data cable to another machine aka a Hot Unplug Attack
    g. In XBLRamDump mode there is a debug feature that can be used to dump memory contents if an attacker has physical access to the device This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed User interaction is not needed for exploitation Product: Android Versions: Android kernel Android ID: A64610940

9. Physical Security and MultiFactor Authentication Examples:
An issue was discovered on Linksys WRT1900ACS 103187766 devices A lack of encryption in how the user login cookie (admin-auth) is stored on a victims computer results in the admin password being discoverable by a local attacker and usable to gain administrative access to the victims router The admin password is stored in base64 cleartext in an admin-auth cookie An attacker sniffing the network at the time of login could acquire the routers admin password Alternatively gaining physical access to the victims computer soon after an administrative login could result in compromise
