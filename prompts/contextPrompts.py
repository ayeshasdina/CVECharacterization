Guest OS Examples:
1. VMware Workstation (15.x before 15.5.2) and Fusion (11.x before 11.5.2) contain a use-after vulnerability in vmnetdhcp. Successful exploitation of this issue may lead to code execution on the host from the guest or may allow attackers to create a denial-of-service condition of the vmnetdhcp service running on the host machine.
2. An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x allowing x86 guest OS users to cause a denial of service or gain privileges because grant-table transfer requests are mishandled.
3. A vulnerability in the IOx application environment for Cisco IOS Software could allow an authenticated  remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Guest Operating System (Guest OS) running on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect role-based access control (RBAC) evaluation when a low-privileged user requests access to a Guest OS that should be restricted to administrative accounts. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the Guest OS by using the low-privileged-user credentials. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Guest OS as a root user.
4. QEMU (aka Quick Emulator)  when built with USB xHCI controller emulator support  allows local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (infinite recursive call) via vectors involving control transfer descriptors sequencing.
5. Memory leak in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator)  when built with USB EHCI Emulation support  allows local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by repeatedly hot-unplugging the device.
6. An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to cause a denial of service or gain privileges by leveraging a page-writability race condition during addition of a passed-through PCI device.
7. Quick Emulator (aka QEMU)  when built with the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support  allows local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access and QEMU process crash) by leveraging incorrect region calculation when updating VGA display.
8. The load_multiboot function in hw/i386/multiboot.c in Quick Emulator (aka QEMU) allows local guest OS users to execute arbitrary code on the QEMU host via a mh_load_end_addr value greater than mh_bss_end_addr  which triggers an out-of-bounds read or write memory access.
9. util/virlog.c in libvirt does not properly determine the hostname on LXC container startup  which allows local guest OS users to bypass an intended container protection mechanism and execute arbitrary commands via a crafted NSS module.
10. In Xen 4.10  new infrastructure was introduced as part of an overhaul to how MSR emulation happens for guests. Unfortunately  one tracking structure isn t freed when a vcpu is destroyed. This allows guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (host OS memory consumption) by rebooting many times.

Channel Examples:
1. wolfSSL 4.3.0 has mulmod code in wc_ecc_mulmod_ex in ecc.c that does not properly resist timing side-channel attacks.
2. A vulnerability in the Secure Shell (SSH) authentication function of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated  remote attacker to successfully log in to an affected device using two distinct usernames. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that may occur when certain sequences of actions are processed during an SSH login event on the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating an SSH session to the device with a specific sequence that presents the two usernames. A successful exploit could result in logging data misrepresentation  user enumeration  or  in certain circumstances  a command authorization bypass. See the Details section for more information.
3. Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus 5.x through 5803 has CSRF on the users  profile information page. Users who are attacked with this vulnerability will be forced to modify their enrolled information  such as email and mobile phone  unintentionally. Attackers could use the reset password function and control the system to send the authentication code back to the channel that the attackers own.
4. BIOTRONIK CardioMessenger II  The affected products transmit credentials in clear-text prior to switching to an encrypted communication channel. An attacker can disclose the product&#8217;s client credentials for connecting to the BIOTRONIK Remote Communication infrastructure.
5. In Philips IntelliBridge EC40 and EC80  IntelliBridge EC40 Hub all versions  and IntelliBridge EC80 Hub all versions  the SSH server running on the affected products is configured to allow weak ciphers. This could enable an unauthorized attacker with access to the network to capture and replay the session and gain unauthorized access to the EC40/80 hub.
6. SSL-Proxy feature on SRX devices fails to handle a hardware resource limitation which can be exploited by remote SSL/TLS servers to crash the flowd daemon. Repeated crashes of the flowd daemon can result in an extended denial of service condition. For this issue to occur  clients protected by the SRX device must initiate a connection to the malicious server. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX5000 Series: 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D85; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D180; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S7; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S6  17.4R3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S8; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2.
7. Improper restriction of communication channel to intended endpoints vulnerability in HTTP daemon in Synology SSL VPN Client before 1.2.4-0224 allows remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks via a crafted payload.
8. Philips e-Alert Unit (non-medical device)  Version R2.1 and prior. The software transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors. The Philips e-Alert communication channel is not encrypted which could therefore lead to disclosure of personal contact information and application login credentials from within the same subnet.
9. The NetIQ Identity Manager communication channel  in versions prior to 4.7  is susceptible to a DoS attack.
10. ffxivlauncher.exe in Square Enix Final Fantasy XIV 4.21 and 4.25 on Windows is affected by Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel  allowing a man-in-the-middle attacker to steal user credentials because a session retrieves global.js via http before proceeding to use https. This is fixed in Patch 4.3.
