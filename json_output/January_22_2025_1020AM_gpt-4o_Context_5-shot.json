The power consumption of each row-based display cycle depends on the number of illuminated pixels  allowing a partial recovery of display contents. For example  a hardware implant in the USB cable might be able to leverage this behavior to recover a data value. In other words  the side channel is relevant only if the attacker has enough control over the device s USB connection to make power-consumption measurements at a time when secret data is displayed. The side channel is not relevant in other circumstances  such as a stolen device that is not currently displaying secret data.
