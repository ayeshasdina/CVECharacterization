This aligns with the definition of a Remote attack, where the attack originates from outside the target network, such as through a web browser. The mention of a \"crafted HTML page\" suggests that the attack can be initiated over the internet, which is characteristic of Remote attack vectors."

            "CVE Description": "A hard-coded encryption key vulnerability exists in the authentication functionality of WAGO eCockpit version 1.5.1.1. An attacker with access to communications between eCockpit and CoDeSyS Gateway can trivially recover the password of any user attempting to log in  in plain text.",

            "ourLabels": "Limited Rmt",
            "modelReasoning": "The vulnerability involves intercepting communications between eCockpit and CoDeSyS Gateway, which suggests that the attacker needs to be in proximity to the network where these communications occur. This aligns with the \"Limited Remote\" attack theater, where exploits are executed from closer proximity using specific technologies with range constraints, such as wireless networks. The ability to intercept communications indicates a need for access to the network, which is characteristic of Limited Remote attacks."

This aligns with the definition of a Remote attack, which involves cyberattacks originating from locations outside the target network, such as public websites or web browsers. The mention of obtaining sensitive information from process memory via a crafted HTML page suggests that the attack can be executed remotely without requiring physical or local access to the system."

            "modelReasoning": "The CVE description specifies that the vulnerability allows a remote user on an adjacent network to access information. This implies that the attack is not fully remote but requires proximity, such as being on the same local network or subnet, which aligns with the characteristics of a Limited Remote attack."

            "modelReasoning": "The CVE description involves keystroke injection in Logitech Unifying devices, which typically use wireless communication (e.g., Bluetooth or proprietary wireless protocols). This type of attack falls under the \"Limited Remote\" category because it involves exploiting wireless communication technologies, which have range constraints and require proximity to the target device."

This aligns with the \"Limited Remote\" attack theater, which includes exploits initiated through wireless (802.11x) networks. The mention of Wi-Fi and the nature of the device indicate that the attack requires proximity to the wireless network, fitting the Limited Remote category."

These types of vulnerabilities typically fall under the \"Limited Remote\" category because they often require proximity to the network or device, such as being on the same local network or within range of the device's wireless capabilities, to exploit the vulnerability. This aligns with the characteristics of Limited Remote attacks, which involve exploits executed from closer proximity using specific technologies with range constraints."

            "modelReasoning": "The CVE description involves an authentication bypass in NETGEAR WAC510 devices. Given that these are network devices, the vulnerability likely involves an attacker exploiting the device over a network connection. Since the description does not specify a broader remote context, such as the internet, and considering the nature of network devices, it is reasonable to classify this as a Limited Remote attack. This is because the attack likely requires proximity to the network, such as being on the same local network or within wireless range, which aligns with the Limited Remote category."
