            "ourLabels": "Remote",
            "modelReasoning": "The CVE description indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker through a crafted HTML page. This aligns with the definition of a Remote attack, which involves cyberattacks originating from outside the target network, such as through web browsers or public websites. The mention of a \"crafted HTML page\" suggests that the attack can be initiated over the internet, fitting the Remote attack theater."

            "CVE Description": "A hard-coded encryption key vulnerability exists in the authentication functionality of WAGO eCockpit version 1.5.1.1. An attacker with access to communications between eCockpit and CoDeSyS Gateway can trivially recover the password of any user attempting to log in  in plain text.",
            "theirLabels": "Local",
            "ourLabels": "Limited Rmt",
            "modelReasoning": "The vulnerability involves intercepting communications between eCockpit and CoDeSyS Gateway, which suggests that the attacker needs to be in proximity to the network where these communications occur. This aligns with the Limited Remote attack theater, where exploits are executed from closer proximity using specific technologies with range constraints, such as wireless networks. The description does not indicate the need for physical access or logical local access, and it is not purely remote as it involves intercepting specific communications."

            "CVE Description": "Insufficient policy enforcement in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 14.0.0.0 allowed a remote attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via a crafted HTML page.",

This aligns with the definition of a Remote attack, which involves cyberattacks originating from locations outside the target network, such as public websites or web browsers. The mention of obtaining sensitive information from process memory via a crafted HTML page suggests that the attack can be executed remotely without requiring physical or local access to the system."

            "ourLabels": "Limited Rmt",
            "modelReasoning": "The CVE description specifies that the vulnerability allows a remote user on an \"adjacent network\" to access information. This implies that the attack is not fully remote but requires proximity, such as being on the same local network or subnet, which aligns with the characteristics of a Limited Remote attack. Limited Remote attacks typically involve exploits that require closer proximity or specific network conditions, such as being on the same Wi-Fi network, which fits the description provided."

This aligns with the definition of the Physical attack theater, where the attacker needs direct physical access to the target system."

            "modelReasoning": "The CVE description involves keystroke injection in Logitech Unifying devices, which typically use wireless communication (e.g., Bluetooth or proprietary wireless protocols). This type of attack falls under the \"Limited Remote\" category as it involves exploiting wireless communication technologies with range constraints, allowing an attacker to inject keystrokes from a nearby location."

            "modelReasoning": "The CVE description involves a Wi-Fi Extender device, which suggests that the attack is likely executed over a wireless network. This aligns with the \"Limited Remote\" attack theater, which includes exploits initiated through wireless (802.11x) networks. The mention of Wi-Fi and the nature of the attack (CSRF with PSK key disclosure) indicates that the attacker needs to be within the range of the wireless network to carry out the exploit."

These types of vulnerabilities typically fall under the \"Limited Remote\" category because they often require proximity to the network, such as being on the same local network or within range of the device's wireless signal, to exploit the vulnerability.

            "modelReasoning": "The CVE description involves an authentication bypass in NETGEAR WAC510 devices. Given that these are network devices, the vulnerability likely involves an attacker exploiting the device from an adjacent network, such as a local Wi-Fi network, which aligns with the \"Limited Remote\" attack theater. This is consistent with other similar CVEs involving network devices where the attack is executed from a nearby network rather than from a completely remote location."
