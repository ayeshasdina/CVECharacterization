            "ourLabels": "Remote",
            "modelReasoning": "The CVE description indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker through a crafted HTML page. This aligns with the definition of a Remote attack, where the attack originates from outside the target network, such as through a web browser. The mention of a \"crafted HTML page\" suggests that the attack can be executed over the internet, which is characteristic of Remote attack vectors."

            "CVE Description": "A hard-coded encryption key vulnerability exists in the authentication functionality of WAGO eCockpit version 1.5.1.1. An attacker with access to communications between eCockpit and CoDeSyS Gateway can trivially recover the password of any user attempting to log in  in plain text.",

            "modelReasoning": "The vulnerability involves intercepting communications between eCockpit and CoDeSyS Gateway, which suggests that the attacker needs to be in proximity to the network where these communications occur. This aligns with the \"Limited Remote\" attack theater, where exploits are executed from closer proximity using specific technologies with range constraints, such as wireless networks."

        {
            "CVE Description": "Insufficient policy enforcement in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 14.0.0.0 allowed a remote attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via a crafted HTML page.",

This aligns with the definition of a Remote attack, where the attack originates from outside the target network, such as through a web browser. The mention of obtaining sensitive information from process memory via a crafted HTML page suggests that the attack can be executed remotely without requiring physical or local access to the system."

            "modelReasoning": "The CVE description specifies that the vulnerability allows a remote user on an \"adjacent network\" to access information. This implies that the attack is not fully remote but requires proximity, such as being on the same local network or subnet, which aligns with the characteristics of a Limited Remote attack."

This aligns with the \"Limited Remote\" attack theater, as it involves exploiting wireless communication to bypass encryption, fitting the subcategory of wireless attacks."

This aligns with the \"Limited Remote\" attack theater, which includes exploits initiated through wireless (802.11x) networks. The mention of PSK (Pre-Shared Key) disclosure further supports the involvement of Wi-Fi, as PSK is commonly used in Wi-Fi security protocols."

These types of vulnerabilities typically fall under the \"Limited Remote\" category because they often require the attacker to be on the same network or in close proximity to exploit the vulnerability, such as through Wi-Fi or other local network connections. The description does not specify the need for physical access or direct local access, which rules out the \"Physical\" and \"Local\" categories, and it does not explicitly mention a remote attack over the internet, which would be classified as \"Remote.\""
