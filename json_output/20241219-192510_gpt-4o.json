            "ourLabels": "Remote",
            "modelReasoning": "The CVE description indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker through a crafted HTML page. This aligns with the definition of a Remote attack, where the attack originates from outside the target network, typically through public websites or web browsers. The mention of a \"crafted HTML page\" suggests that the attack can be executed over the internet without requiring proximity or local access, fitting the Remote attack theater."

            "CVE Description": "A hard-coded encryption key vulnerability exists in the authentication functionality of WAGO eCockpit version 1.5.1.1. An attacker with access to communications between eCockpit and CoDeSyS Gateway can trivially recover the password of any user attempting to log in  in plain text.",
            "theirLabels": "Local",

            "modelReasoning": "The vulnerability involves intercepting communications between eCockpit and CoDeSyS Gateway, which suggests that the attacker needs to be in proximity to the network where these communications occur. This aligns with the \"Limited Remote\" attack theater, where exploits are executed from closer proximity using specific technologies with range constraints, such as wireless networks. The description does not indicate the need for physical access or logical local access, and it is not a purely remote attack since it involves intercepting communications, which typically requires being on the same network or within range."

            "CVE Description": "Insufficient policy enforcement in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 14.0.0.0 allowed a remote attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via a crafted HTML page.",

This aligns with the definition of a Remote attack, which involves cyberattacks originating from locations outside the target network, such as public websites or web browsers. The mention of obtaining sensitive information from process memory via a crafted HTML page suggests that the attack can be executed remotely without requiring physical or local access to the system."

            "modelReasoning": "The CVE description specifies that the vulnerability allows a remote user on an adjacent network to access information. This implies that the attack is not fully remote but requires proximity, such as being on the same local network or subnet, which aligns with the characteristics of a Limited Remote attack."

This aligns with the definition of the Physical attack theater, where the attacker needs direct physical access to the target system."

            "modelReasoning": "The CVE description involves keystroke injection in Logitech Unifying devices, which typically use wireless communication (e.g., Bluetooth or proprietary wireless protocols). This type of attack falls under the \"Limited Remote\" category as it involves exploiting wireless communication technologies with range constraints, allowing an attacker to inject keystrokes from a nearby location."

This aligns with the \"Limited Remote\" attack theater, which includes exploits initiated through wireless (802.11x) networks. The mention of Wi-Fi and the nature of the attack (CSRF with PSK key disclosure) indicates that the attacker is exploiting vulnerabilities in the wireless communication, which is characteristic of a Limited Remote attack."

These types of vulnerabilities typically fall under the \"Limited Remote\" category because they often require proximity to the network or device, such as being on the same local network or within range of the device's wireless capabilities, to exploit the vulnerability. This aligns with the characteristics of Limited Remote attacks, which involve short-range technologies like Wi-Fi."

            "modelReasoning": "The CVE description involves an authentication bypass in NETGEAR WAC510 devices. Given that these are network devices, the vulnerability likely involves an attacker exploiting the device over a network connection. Since the description does not specify a remote attack from outside the network, it is reasonable to classify this as a Limited Remote attack, which typically involves network-based exploits that require proximity or adjacency, such as those affecting wireless or network devices."
