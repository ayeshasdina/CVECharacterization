## Overview

This project explores the use of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**—specifically GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1-405B, and Gemini 1.5 Flash—to automate the characterization of cybersecurity vulnerabilities using **N-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning**.

The goal is to classify CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) into 27 categories across five noun groups, as defined by the **NIST Vulnerability Description Ontology (VDO)**:
- Attack Theater
- Context
- Impact Method
- Logical Impact
- Mitigation

The approach relies on prompt engineering and few-shot examples, without requiring fine-tuning or large amounts of labeled data.
